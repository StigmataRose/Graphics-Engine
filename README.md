# Graphics Engine from Scratch

## Overview

The primary focus of the project is on implementing a projection matrix to facilitate accurate rendering. This project was created to foster familiarity and proficiency in writing and implementing the graphics pipeline. It covers aspects ranging from vertex and fragment shaders to graphics card programming and establishing communication with the CPU.

## Features

- OpenGL render engine
- Projection matrix implementation
- Use Image as Texture
- Project 2D Shapes
- Support for .ply and .obj 3D formats (Work in progress)
- Lighting (Work in progress)
- File to buffer conversion (Work in progress)
